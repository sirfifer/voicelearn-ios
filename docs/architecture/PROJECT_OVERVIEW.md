# UnaMentis - Project Overview

## Purpose

UnaMentis is an AI-powered voice tutoring platform that enables extended (60-90+ minute) educational conversations. The project addresses limitations in existing voice AI (like ChatGPT's Advanced Voice Mode) by providing low-latency, natural voice interaction with curriculum-driven learning.

**Vision:** AI-powered learning that makes you smarter, not dependent. A personalized tutor that works with you over long stretches of time, understands your learning progress and style, and evolves into a true personal tutor, while ensuring genuine understanding through teachback, productive struggle, and spaced retrieval.

**Core Principle:** AI is at the core of what we're building, but the real core is the individual learner. UnaMentis exists to strengthen, not replace, the cognitive work of genuine understanding.

**Development Model:** 100% AI-assisted development (Claude Code mostly).

See [About UnaMentis](ABOUT.md) for our complete philosophy and values.

#### Kyutai Pocket TTS (On-Device Neural TTS)

**Kyutai Pocket TTS represents a paradigm shift in on-device text-to-speech.** Released January 13, 2026 under the MIT license, this 100-million parameter model delivers neural TTS quality that rivals cloud services while running entirely on-device, without requiring specialized hardware acceleration.

**Why This Is Game-Changing:**

Until now, on-device TTS meant a choice between robotic-sounding system voices (Apple TTS) or multi-gigabyte neural models requiring Neural Engine or GPU acceleration. Kyutai Pocket breaks this tradeoff entirely:

- **100M Parameters (~100MB total):** Small enough to download once and always have available
- **CPU-Only Execution:** Runs on ANY device, even older iPhones without Neural Engine optimization
- **~200ms Time-to-First-Byte:** Comparable to cloud services, but with zero network dependency
- **1.84% Word Error Rate:** Best-in-class accuracy for on-device TTS
- **8 Built-in Voices:** Named after Les Misérables characters (Alba, Marius, Javert, Jean, Fantine, Cosette, Eponine, Azelma)
- **5-Second Voice Cloning:** Create custom voices from just 5 seconds of reference audio
- **24kHz Output:** High-quality audio matching cloud TTS services

**Architecture:**
- 6-layer transformer backbone (~70M params)
- MLP sampler for consistency (~10M params)
- Mimi VAE decoder for waveform generation (~20M params)
- JSON tokenizer with 4000-token vocabulary
- Voice embedding bank (~4MB, 8 built-in voices)

**Implementation:**
- **Inference Engine:** Rust/Candle (native CPU inference)
- **Why Not CoreML:** Kyutai Pocket uses a stateful streaming transformer (FlowLM) with dynamic KV cache that CoreML cannot support. Rust/Candle provides full control over model execution, proper KV cache management, and better compatibility with modern transformer architectures
- **FFI:** UniFFI-generated Swift bindings for seamless iOS integration
- **Size:** XCFramework is 7MB (device) + 6.9MB (simulator)

**iOS Integration:**

The iOS app includes comprehensive Kyutai Pocket support via native Rust/Candle inference with full "nerd knobs" configuration:

- **Voice Selection:** All 8 built-in voices with preview
- **Sampling Parameters:** Temperature (0.0-1.0), Top-P (0.1-1.0)
- **Speed Control:** 0.5x to 2.0x playback speed
- **Quality Settings:** Consistency steps (1-4) for quality vs. latency tradeoff
- **Performance Toggles:** Neural Engine utilization, prefetch optimization
- **Voice Cloning:** Record or import 5-second reference audio
- **Presets:** Default, Low Latency, High Quality, Battery Saver
- **Model Management:** Download, load, unload with state indicators

Kyutai Pocket is the **primary on-device TTS option** in Voice Settings, positioned above Apple TTS, and is fully integrated with Knowledge Bowl voice practice sessions with automatic fallback to Apple TTS if models are not downloaded.

| **Immediate** | Current segment, recent turns, barge-in | 4,000 |
| **Working** | Current topic content, glossary, misconceptions | 4,000 |
| **Episodic** | Session history, learner signals, completed topics | 2,500 |
| **Semantic** | Curriculum outline, position, prerequisites | 1,500 |

**Adaptive Scaling:** Budgets scale for model context window (Cloud 12K, Mid-range 8K, On-device 4K, Tiny 2K).

**Confidence Monitoring:** Analyzes responses for hedging, deflection, knowledge gaps. Automatically expands context when uncertainty detected.

See [FOV_CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md](FOV_CONTEXT_MANAGEMENT.md) for complete documentation.

### LLM Routing (Patch Panel)

A switchboard system for routing LLM calls to any endpoint:

**Routing Priority:**

### TTS Caching & Session Management

A comprehensive architecture for multi-user tutoring with global audio caching and per-user session state.

**Components:**

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **TTSCache** | Global user-agnostic audio cache (shared across all users) |
| **TTSResourcePool** | Priority-based TTS generation with concurrency limits |
| **SessionCacheIntegration** | Bridge between per-user sessions and global cache |
| **UserSession** | Per-user state with voice config and playback position |
| **ScheduledDeploymentManager** | Admin-triggered curriculum pre-generation |

**Key Design Principles:**

1. **User-Agnostic Cache Keys:** Cache keys contain only `text + voice_id + provider + speed` (no user_id). Users with identical voice configurations share cached audio.

2. **Cross-User Cache Sharing:** When User A generates audio for "Welcome to the lesson" with voice "nova", User B requesting the same text with the same voice gets an instant cache hit (0ms TTS latency).

3. **Priority-Based Generation:**
   - `LIVE (10)` - User actively waiting, highest priority (7 concurrent max)
   - `PREFETCH (5)` - Near-future prefetch, background priority
   - `SCHEDULED (1)` - Background pre-generation (3 concurrent max)

4. **Separate Semaphores:** Live requests never blocked by background generation. Each priority level has its own concurrency pool.

**Performance (tested):**
- Sequential cache hits: 1-3ms latency
- 50 concurrent cache hits: 1,155 req/sec, 35ms avg latency
- Cache storage: Filesystem-based with async I/O

**API Endpoints:**

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/tts` | POST | Generate TTS (cache-first) |
| `/api/tts/cache/stats` | GET | Cache and resource pool stats |
| `/api/tts/cache` | GET | Direct cache lookup |
| `/api/tts/cache` | PUT | Direct cache insertion (dev) |
| `/api/tts/cache` | DELETE | Clear cache |
| `/api/tts/prefetch/topic` | POST | Prefetch topic segments |
| `/api/deployments` | POST/GET | Scheduled pre-generation |

**Corporate Training Example:**
```
500 employees start "Security Training 2024" simultaneously:
- Admin pre-generates all segments the night before
- Day-of: 100% cache hits, 0ms TTS latency for everyone
- Server easily handles 500 concurrent sessions
```
