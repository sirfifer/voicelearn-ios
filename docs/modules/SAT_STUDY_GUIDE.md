1. **Take a Diagnostic Test**
   - Use the built-in diagnostic or official Bluebook practice test
   - Complete under realistic conditions (timed, no interruptions)
   - This establishes your baseline score

2. **Analyze Your Results**
   - Note your section scores (Reading/Writing vs. Math)
   - Identify your 3 weakest skill areas
   - Review every wrong answer to understand why

3. **Set Your Target Score**
   - Be realistic: 100-150 point improvement is typical with serious prep
   - Check target scores for your goal schools
   - Set intermediate milestones

4. **Create Your Study Schedule**
   - Input your test date and weekly available hours
   - The system will generate a personalized plan
   - Commit to consistency over intensity

### Understanding the Digital SAT

## The Two Pillars: Content + Strategy

### Why Both Matter

Many students focus only on content (learning math, improving reading). But strategy is equally important:

| Student A | Student B |
|-----------|-----------|
| Strong content, no strategy | Moderate content, strong strategy |
| Knows all the math | Knows most of the math |
| Runs out of time | Finishes with time to check |
| Misses easy questions | Maximizes easy points |
| Score: 1250 | Score: 1350 |

**Strategy is the multiplier that maximizes your content knowledge.**

### The Four Strategy Pillars

1. **Question Triage**: Know what to attempt, skip, or guess
2. **Process of Elimination**: Systematically narrow choices
3. **Time Management**: Spend time where it earns points
4. **Error Prevention**: Avoid careless mistakes

### Question Triage System

For every question, quickly categorize:

| Category | Recognition | Action | Time |
|----------|-------------|--------|------|
| **Green** | "I know exactly how to do this" | Solve efficiently | Standard |
| **Yellow** | "I can figure this out" | Attempt systematically | Standard + 30s |
| **Red** | "I have no idea" | Strategic guess, move on | 15 seconds max |

**Critical Rule**: Never spend 3+ minutes on any single question. That time is better spent checking easier questions.

### Process of Elimination (POE)

POE works because wrong answers have patterns:

| Wrong Answer Type | How to Spot It |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Too extreme | Uses "always," "never," "only" |
| Off-topic | Addresses something not asked |
| Opposite | Says the reverse of what's correct |
| Half-right | Partially correct but flawed |
| Trap | Uses words from passage misleadingly |

**POE in Action:**
```
Question: What is 2x - 3 = 11?

A) x = 4    ← 2(4) - 3 = 5 ≠ 11 (eliminate)
B) x = 7    ← 2(7) - 3 = 11 ✓ (keep)
C) x = 8    ← 2(8) - 3 = 13 ≠ 11 (eliminate)
D) x = 14   ← 2(14) - 3 = 25 ≠ 11 (eliminate)

Answer: B
```

## Section-by-Section Strategies

### Reading & Writing Section

#### Overview
- 64 minutes for 54 questions (about 71 seconds each)
- Short passages (25-150 words)
- One question per passage
- Four domains tested

#### Domain Strategies

**1. Words in Context (28% of section)**

Strategy: Substitution Method
```
1. Cover the tested word
2. Read surrounding context
3. Predict a simple replacement word
4. Find the answer that matches your prediction
5. Verify by substituting back
```

Example:
> "The scientist's *acute* observations led to the discovery."

- Cover "acute"
- Context suggests careful, precise observations
- Predict: "sharp" or "keen"
- Find matching answer

**Common Trap**: Answer that matches a common meaning but not the contextual meaning.

**2. Central Ideas and Details (26% of section)**

Strategy: Main Point First
```
1. Read the passage actively
2. Ask: "What's the main point?"
3. Predict the answer
4. Eliminate answers that are:
   - Too narrow (just a detail)
   - Too broad (beyond the passage)
   - Contradictory
```

**3. Standard English Conventions (26% of section)**

Strategy: Error Recognition
```
1. Read the underlined portion
2. Identify what's being tested:
   - Punctuation (commas, semicolons, colons)
   - Subject-verb agreement
   - Pronoun issues
   - Modifiers
3. Apply the specific rule
4. Choose the clearest, most concise option
```

Key Rules to Know:
- Comma splice = error (use semicolon or period)
- Semicolons connect complete sentences
- Colons introduce lists or explanations
- Subject and verb must agree (ignore phrases in between)

**4. Expression of Ideas (20% of section)**

Strategy: Purpose-Driven Reading
```
1. Understand what the passage needs
2. Read the question carefully
3. Evaluate each choice for:
   - Relevance to purpose
   - Logical flow
   - Appropriate tone
```

### Math Section

#### Overview
- 70 minutes for 44 questions (about 95 seconds each)
- Built-in Desmos calculator available
- Mix of multiple choice and numeric entry (grid-in)
- Four domains tested

#### Domain Strategies

**1. Algebra (35% of section)**

Core Skills:
- Solve linear equations: isolate the variable
- Systems of equations: substitution or elimination
- Linear functions: understand slope and intercept
- Inequalities: flip sign when multiplying/dividing by negative

Strategy: Show Your Work
```
1. Write out each step
2. Verify signs carefully
3. Check by substituting back
4. Don't skip steps to save time
```

**2. Advanced Math (35% of section)**

Core Skills:
- Quadratics: factor, formula, or completing square
- Exponents: know the rules (multiply = add exponents)
- Polynomials: factor and expand
- Nonlinear functions: recognize shapes

Strategy: Know Multiple Methods
```
For x² - 5x + 6 = 0:
- Factoring: (x-2)(x-3) = 0 → x = 2 or 3
- Formula: x = (5 ± √(25-24))/2 = (5 ± 1)/2
- Graphing: Find x-intercepts on Desmos
```

**3. Problem Solving & Data Analysis (15% of section)**

Core Skills:
- Ratios and proportions: cross-multiply
- Percentages: part/whole × 100
- Statistics: mean, median, mode, range
- Data interpretation: read graphs carefully

Strategy: Mark Up the Data
```
1. Circle what's being asked
2. Note units carefully
3. Extract only needed values
4. Show calculation steps
```

**4. Geometry & Trigonometry (15% of section)**

Core Skills:
- Area and volume formulas
- Triangle properties (similar triangles, Pythagorean theorem)
- Circle properties (circumference, area, arc length)
- Basic trig: SOH-CAH-TOA

Strategy: Draw and Label
```
1. Redraw figures with given info
2. Label all known values
3. Identify what you need to find
4. Write relevant formulas
```

#### Math-Specific Strategies

**Back-Solving**
When given answer choices, plug them in:
```
Question: If 2x + 5 = 17, what is x?
A) 4  B) 6  C) 8  D) 11

Try B: 2(6) + 5 = 17 ✓
Answer: B
```

**Picking Numbers**
For abstract problems, use concrete numbers:
```
Question: If x is a positive integer, which is always odd?
A) 2x  B) 2x+1  C) x²  D) x+1

Pick x = 3:
A) 6 (even)
B) 7 (odd) ✓
C) 9 (odd)
D) 4 (even)

Pick x = 4:
C) 16 (even) ← eliminated

Answer: B
```

**Using Desmos**
The built-in calculator can:
- Graph functions to visualize
- Solve equations by finding intersections
- Check arithmetic quickly
- Create tables of values

## Timing Mastery

### The Timing Trap

Most students either:
- Rush through everything (careless errors)
- Get stuck on hard questions (run out of time)

Neither approach maximizes points.

### Strategic Time Allocation

**Reading & Writing (64 min / 54 questions)**

| Question Type | Target Time | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Grammar/Conventions | 40-50 sec | Usually quick if you know rules |
| Words in Context | 50-60 sec | Use substitution method |
| Central Ideas | 70-80 sec | Read passage carefully |
| Evidence/Synthesis | 80-90 sec | May need rereading |

**Math (70 min / 44 questions)**

| Question Type | Target Time | Notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| Quick algebra | 45-60 sec | Don't overthink |
| Standard problems | 90-120 sec | Show work |
| Word problems | 120-150 sec | Translation takes time |
| Complex/multi-step | 150-180 sec | Maximum investment |

### Time Banking

Build a "time bank" from quick questions:

```
Module 1 (22 math questions, 35 minutes):

Quick questions (8): Target 45 sec → 6 min
Actual: 40 sec → 5 min 20 sec
Saved: 40 seconds

Standard questions (10): Target 100 sec → 16.5 min
Actual: 95 sec → 15.8 min
Saved: 40 seconds more

Time bank: 80 seconds for hard questions
```

### The 90-Second Rule

For any single question:
- After 90 seconds without progress, make your best guess
- Mark it for review
- Move on
- Return only if you have time at the end

---

## The Mental Game

### Test Anxiety is Real

Physical symptoms:
- Racing heart
- Sweaty palms
- Blank mind
- Difficulty focusing

These symptoms reduce working memory and hurt performance.

### Pre-Test Anxiety Management

**Progressive Muscle Relaxation**
```
1. Tense muscle group for 5 seconds
2. Release and relax for 10 seconds
3. Notice the difference
4. Move through all muscle groups
5. Practice daily before test
```

**Visualization**
```
1. Find a quiet space
2. Close your eyes
3. Imagine test day going well
4. Picture yourself calm and confident
5. Visualize success
```

**Cognitive Reframing**
Change your self-talk:
| Instead of... | Think... |
|---------------|----------|
| "I'm going to fail" | "I'm prepared for this" |
| "This is too hard" | "I'll do what I can" |
| "I always mess up" | "I've practiced for this" |

### During-Test Strategies

**Box Breathing (Quick Reset)**
```
Inhale:  4 counts
Hold:    4 counts
Exhale:  4 counts
Hold:    4 counts

Takes 16 seconds, resets nervous system
```

**Grounding Technique**
```
When panicking:
- Feel your feet on the floor
- Notice the chair supporting you
- Take one deep breath
- Focus on the next question only
```

### The RESET Protocol

When you miss a question or make a mistake:
```
R - Recognize (notice without judgment)
E - Exhale (one deep breath)
S - Set aside (that question is done)
E - Engage (focus on next question)
T - Trust (trust your preparation)
```

### Confidence Calibration

| Problem | Sign | Solution |
|---------|------|----------|
| Overconfidence | Rush, skip steps, careless errors | Slow down, verify, check work |
| Underconfidence | Second-guess, change answers, freeze | Trust first instinct, keep moving |
