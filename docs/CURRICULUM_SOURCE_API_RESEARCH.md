# Curriculum Source API and Integration Research

**Version:** 1.1.0
**Date:** 2025-12-30
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of API capabilities, integration policies, and partnership opportunities for all curriculum sources

---

## UnaMentis Integration Model

**IMPORTANT:** UnaMentis operates under a non-commercial educational model for all open/CC-licensed curriculum:

- **Open curriculum is ALWAYS FREE** to users
- **Open curriculum is ALWAYS ATTRIBUTED** to original sources
- **No monetization** of CC/open-licensed educational content
- Commercial curriculum (if any) would only be resold if already commercial

This model means **NonCommercial (NC) license restrictions are NOT a barrier** for UnaMentis. We qualify as non-commercial educational use under all CC NC licenses.

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides detailed research on each curriculum source's official API capabilities, integration policies, licensing terms, and partnership opportunities. The goal is to enable UnaMentis to integrate as a legitimate partner rather than relying on web scraping.

### Quick Reference Matrix

| Source | Official API | Partnership Program | License | NC Barrier? | Best Approach |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **MIT OCW** | No public API | Yes ($100K+ sponsors) | CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 | **No** | Direct use under CC with attribution |
| **MERLOT** | Yes (REST) | Yes ($6.5K-$25K/yr) | Various CC | **No** | Apply for API key (free for non-profit) |
| **CK-12** | No API | Yes (LTI focus) | Proprietary | **Yes - Problematic** | Must partner; scraping prohibited |

## 1. MIT OpenCourseWare

### Overview

MIT OpenCourseWare is a free, publicly accessible collection of over 2,500 MIT courses. While they don't offer a public API, they provide structured content under Creative Commons licensing with several partnership options.

### API and Data Access

**Official API Status: NO PUBLIC API**

MIT OCW does not offer a public REST API for external developers. However, several alternative access methods exist:

#### Available Data Access Methods

| Method | URL/Details | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------|
| **Sitemap XML** | https://ocw.mit.edu/sitemap.xml | Full course listing, permissive robots.txt |
| **ZIP Downloads** | Per-course on website | Self-contained course packages |

#### MIT Internal APIs (Not Public)

- **MIT Learn API**: `https://api.learn.mit.edu` (internal use only)
- **MIT Institutional APIs**: Require SUNetID affiliation
- **Static JSON**: Generated by Hugo themes for course metadata

### robots.txt Analysis

```
User-Agent: *
Allow: /
Sitemap: https://ocw.mit.edu/sitemap.xml
```

**Fully permissive** - allows all crawlers unrestricted access.

### Licensing

**License:** CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 (Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike)

| Permission | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Share (copy, redistribute) | Yes |
| Adapt (remix, transform) | Yes |
| Commercial use | **No** |
| Attribution required | Yes |

Phone: 650-494-1302

### Recommended Integration Approach for UnaMentis

**CK-12 is the MOST PROBLEMATIC source** - even non-commercial use requires partnership.

**The Challenge:**
- Proprietary license (NOT Creative Commons)
- ToS explicitly prohibits scraping and automated access
- ToS explicitly prohibits AI/ML training use
- No public API available
- Our non-commercial status does NOT automatically grant permission

**Required Steps:**
1. **Contact partners@ck12.org** with formal partnership proposal
2. Emphasize educational mission alignment and non-commercial model
3. Propose LTI integration if feasible
4. Wait for explicit written permission before any integration

**DO NOT:**
1. Scrape content (explicitly prohibited even for non-commercial)
2. Use for AI/ML training (prohibited in ToS)
3. Assume our non-commercial status grants any rights (it doesn't for proprietary licenses)
4. Proceed without explicit written agreement

**Bottom Line:** CK-12 requires formal partnership. Consider deprioritizing until partnership is established, as there are many CC-licensed alternatives.

### API and Data Access

**Official API Status: GITHUB REPOSITORIES (No dedicated API)**

Fast.ai content is accessed primarily through GitHub repositories.

#### Key Repositories

| Repository | Description | Stars | License |
|------------|-------------|-------|---------|
| [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) | Deep learning library | 27,757 | Apache-2.0 |
| [fastbook](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook) | Course notebooks | 24,200 | **DUAL (see below)** |

#### Access Methods

- **Course website**: course.fast.ai
- **YouTube**: Video lectures with captions
- **Google Colab**: Run notebooks directly
- **Kaggle/Paperspace**: Recommended platforms
- **Documentation**: docs.fast.ai

### Licensing

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION: Library vs. Educational Content**

#### The fastai Library (Apache 2.0)

The **software library** is licensed under Apache 2.0:

| Permission | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Commercial use | **Yes** |
| Modification | Yes |
| Distribution | Yes |
| Patent use | Yes |
| Private use | Yes |

**Requirements:** Include license/copyright notice, state changes

Confirmed by team: "Yes, you can use fastai for commercial purposes."

#### The fastbook Repository (RESTRICTIVE Dual License)

**Code (GPL v3):**
- Python code in notebooks and .py files
- Allows commercial use but derivatives must be GPL v3
- Source code must be made available

**Prose/Markdown Content (PROPRIETARY):**
- All markdown cells and written content
- Copyright Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger, 2020+
- **NOT licensed for redistribution or change of format**
- Only permitted: copies/forks for **private use only**
- **NO commercial or broadcast use**

#### What This Means

**You CANNOT:**
- Republish the educational prose content
- Create derivative works from written materials
- Use book content commercially
- Host the content elsewhere

**You CAN:**
- Use the fastai library in commercial applications
- Link to official course materials
- Fork repositories for private learning
- Build products using the library's APIs

### Contact Information

| Channel | Details |
|---------|---------|
| Forums | forums.fast.ai |
| GitHub | github.com/fastai |
| Twitter | @fastdotai |
| Website | fast.ai |

**Key People:**
- Jeremy Howard: Founding CEO of Answer.AI, @jeremyphoward
- Rachel Thomas: Professor at Queensland University of Technology

### Recommended Integration Approach for UnaMentis

**Fast.ai has a DUAL LICENSE that creates challenges** - library is fine, prose is not.

**What We CAN Use:**
1. fastai Python library (Apache 2.0) - fully usable
2. Links to official course materials and YouTube videos
3. References and citations with attribution
4. nbdev tooling for our own documentation

**What We CANNOT Use (even non-commercially):**
1. Republishing prose/educational content from fastbook (proprietary)
2. Creating derivative educational materials from the book text
3. Hosting notebook content with prose on our platform

**Recommended Approach:**
- Link to Fast.ai courses rather than importing content
- Use the fastai library in our technical implementation
- Reference course materials but don't republish the prose

**Attribution Example:**
```
This project uses the fastai library (https://github.com/fastai/fastai),
licensed under Apache 2.0. Copyright 2017 onwards, fast.ai, Inc.
```

**Bottom Line:** Fast.ai's educational prose content is off-limits even for non-commercial use. Consider as a "link to" resource rather than an import source.

#### Current Status - Conflicting Information

1. **Creative Commons wiki** documents CC BY-SA adoption in 2014
2. **Current website** indicates CC BY-NC-SA (NonCommercial)
3. **SWAYAM Terms** restrict to personal use, prohibit redistribution
4. **Independent analysis** (2024) suggests NPTEL asserts copyright without clear CC release

**Recommendation:** Contact NPTEL directly to clarify licensing before integration.

### Recommended Integration Approach for UnaMentis

**NPTEL has UNCLEAR licensing** - must clarify before proceeding.

**The Problem:**
- Creative Commons wiki says CC BY-SA (no NC) as of 2014
- Current website appears to say CC BY-NC-SA
- SWAYAM Terms restrict to "personal use"
- Independent analysis suggests no clear CC release

**Required First Step:**
1. **Email NPTEL@iitm.ac.in** to request clarification on current licensing
2. Ask specifically: "Can we use NPTEL content in a free, non-commercial educational app with full attribution?"
3. Request written confirmation of license terms

**If Confirmed as CC:**
- We qualify for non-commercial educational use
- YouTube API available for video access
- Transcripts available in multiple languages
- Massive engineering content library

**If License is Restrictive:**
- Apply for NIA (Industry Associate) partnership
- Contact outside-india@nptel.iitm.ac.in for international use

**Bottom Line:** Do NOT proceed with NPTEL integration until licensing is clarified in writing. The content is valuable but the legal situation is murky.

## Appendix D: Recommended Priority Order for UnaMentis

Based on API availability, license compatibility with our non-commercial model, and integration ease:

### Tier 1: Ideal Sources (API available, fully compatible)

1. **OpenStax** - Public API, CC BY 4.0, no authentication needed, high-quality collegiate content
2. **BCcampus** - Pressbooks REST API, CC BY 4.0, excellent K-12 and collegiate textbooks
3. **MERLOT** - REST API available, free for non-profit academic use, curated OER catalog

### Tier 2: Excellent Sources (No API but fully compatible)

4. **MIT OCW** - No API but permissive robots.txt, CC BY-NC-SA (we qualify), world-class content
5. **Stanford SEE** - Download ZIPs, CC BY-NC-SA (we qualify), elite engineering courses
6. **OpenLearn** - SPARQL endpoint available, CC BY-NC-SA (we qualify), broad subject coverage

### Tier 3: Good Sources (Require some setup)

7. **OER Commons** - API with token required, contact info@oercommons.org, aggregator of many sources
8. **NPTEL** - YouTube API available, **must clarify licensing first**, massive engineering content

### Tier 4: Problematic Sources (Significant barriers)

9. **Fast.ai** - Library code is fine (Apache 2.0), but **educational prose cannot be republished**
10. **CK-12** - **Proprietary license, scraping prohibited, AI/ML use prohibited** - requires formal LTI partnership agreement

### Key Insight

With UnaMentis's non-commercial model, **8 of 10 sources are fully compatible** without special arrangements. The NC (NonCommercial) restrictions that would block commercial apps do not apply to us.

**Only two sources require special handling:**
- **CK-12**: Proprietary license with explicit prohibitions - must pursue partnership
- **Fast.ai prose**: Cannot republish book content - can only link/reference
