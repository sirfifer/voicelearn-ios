**Real-time bidirectional, hands free, mobile, voice learning platform that uses AI on device and on a server to provide extensive learning sessions.
These sessions can be ad-hoc or based on proven curriculum from many well known sources.**

## Why UnaMentis?

We live in an age where AI can write essays, solve problems, and answer any question instantly. This power is extraordinary, but it's also dangerous without foundation. A calculator is useless to someone who doesn't understand what multiplication means. AI writing is hollow to someone who has never formed their own thoughts.

**UnaMentis takes a different approach: AI as tutor, not substitute.**

We use artificial intelligence to deliver personalized, voice-based instruction at scale. But our goal isn't to give you answers. It's to build genuine understanding. We challenge you to explain concepts back in your own words. We celebrate the time you spend thinking before asking for help. We revisit what you learned last week to make sure you truly remember it.

This is a personalized tutor that works with you over extended sessions (60-90+ minutes), develops an understanding of your learning progress and style, and evolves into a true personal tutor over time. Quality curriculum, often from institutions like MIT, combined with AI that guides rather than replaces, creates something powerful: a tutor that makes you genuinely smarter.

**This is education technology that serves learning, not shortcuts.**

### Core Principles

- **Genuine Understanding**: We reinforce real comprehension through teachback, productive struggle, and spaced retrieval
- **Quality Curriculum**: Content from respected sources (MIT, CK-12, and more), designed for voice-based delivery
- **Privacy-First**: On-device capabilities, user control, and transparent data practices
- **Open Source Core**: The fundamental infrastructure will always remain open source

See [About UnaMentis](docs/ABOUT.md) for our complete philosophy and [docs/PHILOSOPHY.md](docs/PHILOSOPHY.md) for the founding vision.

## Overview

UnaMentis is an iOS application that enables 60-90+ minute voice-based learning sessions with AI tutoring. Built for iPhone 16/17 Pro Max with emphasis on:

- Sub-500ms end-to-end latency
- Natural interruption handling (no push-to-talk)
- Curriculum-driven learning with progress tracking
- Comprehensive observability and cost tracking
- Modular architecture with swappable providers

## Provider Flexibility

UnaMentis is designed to be provider-agnostic with strong emphasis on on-device capabilities. The system supports pluggable providers for every component of the voice AI pipeline:

- **STT (Speech-to-Text)**: On-device (Apple Speech, GLM-ASR), cloud (Deepgram, AssemblyAI), or self-hosted (Whisper)
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech)**: On-device (Apple), cloud (ElevenLabs, Deepgram Aura), or self-hosted (VibeVoice, Piper)
- **LLM**: On-device (Ministral-3B via llama.cpp), self-hosted (Mistral 7B via Ollama), or cloud (Anthropic, OpenAI)
- **Embeddings**: OpenAI or compatible embedding services
- **VAD**: Silero (Core ML, on-device)

The right model depends on the task, the moment, and the cost. The architecture prioritizes flexibility so you can:

- Swap providers without code changes
- Use different models for different tasks (fast/cheap for simple responses, powerful for complex explanations)
- Run entirely on-device for privacy, offline use, or zero API costs
- Self-host models on local servers for cost control
- A/B test provider combinations to find optimal setups

# Full provider comparison (~30 min)
python -m latency_harness.cli --suite provider_comparison --no-mock
```

Features:
- High-precision timing (nanosecond on iOS via `mach_absolute_time`)
- Network projections (localhost, WiFi, cellular)
- Baseline comparison for regression detection
- Web dashboard at Operations Console → Latency Tests
- REST API for programmatic access

## Code Quality Infrastructure

UnaMentis implements a comprehensive **5-phase Code Quality Initiative** that enables enterprise-grade quality standards through intelligent automation:

### Quality Gates

| Gate | Threshold | Enforcement |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| Code Coverage | 80% minimum | CI fails if below |
| Latency (P50) | 500ms | CI warns/fails on regression |
| SwiftLint | Zero violations | Pre-commit hook |
| Security Scan | Zero critical findings | CI + weekly audit |

### Automation Tools

- **Pre-commit Hooks**: SwiftLint, SwiftFormat, Ruff, ESLint, Gitleaks
- **Hook Bypass Auditing**: Detect `--no-verify` usage with `scripts/hook-audit.sh`
- **Dependency Management**: Renovate with auto-merge for patches
- **AI Code Review**: CodeRabbit (free for open source)
- **Performance Testing**: Automated latency regression detection
- **Security Scanning**: CodeQL, Gitleaks, pip-audit, npm audit
- **DORA Metrics**: Apache DevLake for engineering health
- **Mutation Testing**: Weekly validation with mutmut (Python), Stryker (Web), Muter (iOS)
- **Chaos Engineering**: Voice pipeline resilience testing (see [runbook](docs/testing/CHAOS_ENGINEERING_RUNBOOK.md))

### Feature Flags

Self-hosted Unleash system with full lifecycle management:
- iOS SDK with SwiftUI integration
- Web SDK with React hooks
- Automated stale flag detection

```bash
# Install quality infrastructure
./scripts/install-hooks.sh      # Git hooks
./scripts/hook-audit.sh         # Check for bypasses
cd server/devlake && docker compose up -d    # DORA metrics
cd server/feature-flags && docker compose up -d  # Feature flags
```

See [docs/quality/CODE_QUALITY_INITIATIVE.md](docs/quality/CODE_QUALITY_INITIATIVE.md) for the complete quality initiative documentation, including mutation testing and chaos engineering.

## Project Vision

### Open Source Core

The fundamental core of UnaMentis will always remain open source. This ensures the greatest possible audience can collaborate on and utilize this work. The open source commitment includes:

- Core voice pipeline and session management
- Curriculum system and progress tracking
- All provider integrations
- Cross-platform support (planned)

### Current Platform Support

- **iOS**: Primary platform, fully functional (iPhone 16/17 Pro Max optimized)
- **Web**: Browser-based voice tutoring (Chrome, Safari, Edge recommended)
- **Server**: Management API and Operations Console for curriculum and infrastructure management

### Future Directions

- **Desktop apps**: Native macOS and Windows applications
- **Plugin architecture**: Extensible system for value-added capabilities
- **Enhanced collaboration**: Multi-user learning sessions

Note: Android support was explored but is not currently in active development. The focus is on delivering exceptional iOS and web experiences first.
