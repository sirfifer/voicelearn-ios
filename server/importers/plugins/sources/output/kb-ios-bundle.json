As thanks for his services as a courier, a possible Armenian spy named Johannes Diodato was permitted to establish one of these places. The low price of admission into these places led to them being nicknamed \"penny universities\" in England. After enacting a law outlawing these places, (*) Murad IV would walk in disguise with a large sword to kill any patrons. Using spoils from the Ottoman camp after the 1683 siege of Vienna, Jerzy Kulczycki (\"cool-CHIS-kee\") established one of these places in the city. Many of these places relied on an ingredient that had to be imported from the Yemeni port of Mocha.
