And this pulley will have a rope attached\n\nto it, wrapped around it.\n\nAnd here we have object 1.\n\nAnd the rope goes around the pulley.\n\nAnd now it's going to go around another pulley B and fixed to the ceiling.\n\nSo that's fixed.\n\nAnd hanging from pulley B is another mass 2.\n\nAnd our goal in applying Newton's second law is to find the accelerations of objects 1 and 2.\n\nNow, how do we approach this?\n\nWell, the first thing we have to do is decide if we're going to apply Newton's second law, what is the system that\nwe'll apply it to?\n\nAnd there's many different ways to choose a system.\n\nWhen we look at this problem, we'll have several different systems.\n\nSo let's consider the ones that we're going to look at.\n\nAnd the first one is very simple.\n\nIt will be block 1.\n\nAnd the second system that we look at, we'll call that AB is pulley A.\n\nNow that brings us to an interesting question about pulley B and block 2, because we could separately look at\n\npulley B, and we could separately consider block 2, or we consider them together.\n\nAnd I want to first consider separately pulley B and block 2.\n\fNow in some ways when you're looking at a compound system, and it has four objects, it makes sense to apply\n\nNewton's second law to each object separately.\n\nBut we'll pay careful attention to the fact that object 2 is connected to pulley B.\n\nAnd eventually, we'll see that we can combine these two things.\n\nSo the next step is once we have identified our object is to draw a free body force diagrams for each of the\nobjects.\n\nSo in order to do that, let's start with object 1.\n\nAnd we want to consider the forces on object 1.\n\nNow that brings us to our first issue about what types of assumptions we're making in our system.\n\nFor instance, we have a rope that's wrapped around this pulley.\n\nAnd we have two pulleys that in principle could be rotating.\n\nBut what we'd like to do to simplify our analysis-- so let's keep track of some assumptions here.\n\nOur first assumption will be that the mass, MP, of pulley A and the mass of pulley B are approximately zero.\n\nNow the reason for that is that we're not going to consider any of the fact that these objects have to be put into\n\nrotational motion.\n\nLater on in the course, we'll see that this will give us a more complicated analysis.\n\nWe're also going to assume that our rope is not slipping.\n\nSo the rope is actually is just slipping on the pulleys.\n\nSo what that means is it's just the rope is sliding as the objects move.\n\nNow again, what this is going to imply is that the tension in the rope-- this rope is also slipping.\n\nAnd the rope is massless as well.\n\nIt's very light rope.\n\nAnd all of these assumptions we've seen when we analyze ropes tell us that the tension T is uniform in the rope.\n\fSo that's our first assumption.\n\nAnd we need to think about this before we even begin to think about the forces on the object.\n\nAnd now we can draw our forces.\n\nWhat do we have?\n\nWe have the gravitational force on object 1.\n\nAnd now we can identify the tension pulling in the string, pulling object 1 up.\n\nNow for every time we introduce a free body diagram, recall that we have to choose what we mean by positive\n\ndirections.\n\nAnd in this case, I'm going to pick a unit vector down, j hat 1 down.\n\nSo that's my positive direction for force.\n\nNow before I write down all of Newton's laws, I'll just write down our various force diagrams.\n\nSo for pulley A, I have two strings that are pulling it downwards.\n\nSo I have tension and tension.\n\nAnd this string, I'm going to call that T2, is holding that pulley up.\n\nSo we have the force diagram.\n\nNow I could write MAG, but we've assumed that the pulley is massless.\n\nAnd again, I'll call j hat A down.\n\nFor object 2, let's do pulley B first.\n\nNow what are the forces on pulley B?\n\nI have strings on both sides, T. Pulley B is massless, so I'm not putting gravitational force.\n\nAnd this string is pulling B downwards, so that's T3.\n\nAnd again, we'll write j hat B downwards.\n\fAnd finally, I have block 2.\n\nSo I'll draw that over here.\n\nI'll write block 2.\n\nIn fact, let's say a little space here.\n\nWe'll have j hat B downwards.\n\nNow block 2, what do we have there?\n\nWe have the string pulling up block 2, which we've identified as T3.\n\nAnd we have the gravitational force on block 2 downward, M2 g.\n\nAnd there we have j had 2.\n\nSo I've now drawn the free body diagram of the various objects.\n\nAnd that enables me to apply Newton's second law for each of these objects.\n\nSo let's begin.\n\nWe'll start with object 1.\n\nWe have-- remember in all cases, we're going to apply F equals m a.\n\nSo for object 1, we have m1g positive downward minus T is equal to m1 a1.\n\nAnd that's our F equals m a on object 1.\n\nSo sometimes we'll distinguish that the forces we're getting from our free body diagram.\n\nAnd A is a mathematical description of the motion.\n\nFor block 2, we have m2g minus T3 is equal to m2 a2.\n\nAnd now for pulley A, we have 2T pointing downwards minus T2 going upwards.\n\nAnd because pulley A is massless, this is zero even though pulley A may be-- it's actually fixed too.\n\nSo it's not even accelerating.\n\fSo it's not even accelerating.\n\nAnd what we see here is this equation-- I'm going to quickly note that it tells us that the string holding pulley 2 up,\nT2, is equal to 2T.\n\nSo we can think of if, we want to know what T2 is, we need to calculate T.\n\nAnd finally we have B. And what is the forces on B?\n\nWe have T3 minus 2T.\n\nAnd again pulley B is 0.\n\nAnd so we see that T3 is equal to 2T.\n\nNow if you think about what I said before about combining systems, if we combine pulley B in block 2, visually\nwhat we're doing is we're just adding these to free body diagram together.\n\nWhen we have a system B and block 2.\n\nLet's call this j hat downwards.\n\nAnd when we add these free body diagram together, you see that the T3 is now internal force to the system.\n\nIt cancels in pair by Newton's second law.\n\nAnd all we have is the two strings going up, so we have T and T. And we have the gravitational force downward.\n\nAnd separately, when we saw that T3 equals 2T and we apply it there, then if we consider a system B2, and look\n\nat our free body diagram, we have m2g minus 2T-- and notice we have the same result their 2T equals m2 a2.\n\nSo in principle now-- and I'll outline our equations.\n\nWe have equation 1.\n\nWe have equation 2.\n\nAnd in these two equations, we have three unknowns, T, A1, and A2, but only two equations.\n\nAnd so you might think, what about this missing third equation here?\n\nHowever, in this equation, we have a fourth unknown, T3.\n\fAnd this equation is just relating to T and T3.\n\nSo in principle, we would have four unknowns and three equations.\n\nOr if we restrict our attention to these two equations, we have three unknowns and two equations.\n\nAre unknowns T, A1 and A2.\n\nThese are our unknowns.\n\nAnd now our next step is to try to figure out what is the missing condition that's relating the sum of these\nunknowns.\n\nAnd that will be a constraint condition that we'll analyze next.",

We can introduce a quantity\nwe call the momentum of that particle.\n\nI'll label it with the symbol p.\n\nAnd it's equal to the product of the mass times the velocity.\n\nThis is something you've undoubtedly seen before.\n\nNow, let's think about the dimensions of momentum for a moment.\n\nSo dimensionally, momentum has units of mass times the velocity.\n\nAnd so that's in SI units, the units of mass are kilograms and then the units of velocity are meters per second.\n\nYou can also express momentum dimensionally as a product of a force times time.\n\nAnd so, again in SI units, units force are the Newton and the units of time is the second.\n\nSo these are the SI units for momentum, two different ways of writing the same dimensions.\n\nNow, we've seen that for a single particle, we can write Newton's second law as the force is equal to the mass\ntimes the acceleration.\n\nOr equivalently, we can write that as the mass times the time derivative of the acceleration, dv/dt.\n\nNow, if m is a constant, then I can rewrite this as F is equal to the time derivative of the mass times the velocity, or\n\nequivalently as the time derivative of the momentum, since mv is just equal to p.\n\nSo I actually want to stress this much-- I'm going to put it in a box because it's very important that I can write\nNewton's second law, instead of F equals ma, as F equals the time derivative of the momentum.\n\nAnd this is absolutely where we'll see the momentum becomes very useful.\n\nBecause it turns out that this form of Newton's second law is actually the most general form of the equation\n\nbecause it's applicable not just to a single point mass, but also to a more complicated system.\n\nA system consisting of many masses or a system where the masses changing or the masses flowing, as in a fluid.\n\nIn all of those cases, this form of Newton's second law is correct.\n\nF equals ma, which is probably more familiar to you, is actually a special case of this law for the case of a single\n\fpoint mass.\n\nSo this is where we'll see that momentum is quite a useful concept, especially as we start considering more\n\ncomplicated systems, as we'll get to a little later in the course.\n\nWhat I want to do now though, is to take a closer look at this equation, force is equal to the time derivative of the\n\nmomentum.\n\nWhenever we have a relation involving a derivative like this, we can always also rewrite it in an equivalent integral\n\nform, which can be very useful and give us a different way of looking at the same information.\n\nSo let's take a look at that.\n\nSo if I take this equation and integrate both sides with respect to time, then I can write that as the integral of F with\n\nrespect to time is equal to the integral of the right-hand side, dp/dt with respect to time.\n\nNow, let's make this a definite integral.\n\nI'll go from time t1 to time t2 on both sides here.\n\nNow, this right-hand side is just-- so the integral of dp/dt with respect to time is just p at time2 minus p at time1.\n\nAnd that is just the change in the momentum vector going from time1 to time2.\n\nNow, this integral on the left-hand side, we give a special name.\n\nWe call this the impulse.\n\nThis name, impulse, calls to mind a short, sharp, shock of some sort.\n\nBut it can also refer to a weak force acting over a long interval.\n\nAnd notice here the function F, the force F, is in general a function of time.\n\nSo this doesn't necessarily mean a constant f.\n\nThis could mean a force that's varying in time.\n\nAnd what this equation tells us is that the change in the momentum of the system doesn't depend on the detailed\ntime dependence of F, but rather just on the integral of F.\n\nAnd so suppose I were to graph the force as a function of time going from time0 to a time delta t.\n\fAnd suppose I had some complicated function that looked like that.\n\nThe impulse is just the area under this curve.\n\nIt's the integral of this function.\n\nThat's the impulse.\n\nAnd the change in the momentum depends only on the area under this curve and not on the detailed shape of the\n\ncurve.\n\nSo what that means is that I can define an average force by choosing a constant force that has the same area as\n\nthis example on the left.\n\nSo suppose I calculated that.\n\nAnd there is some constant force here.\n\nI'll call this F average.\n\nGoing over the same time interval.\n\nThe average force is that constant force which has the same area as the area under my F of t.\n\nSo in other words, F average times delta t, which is the area on the right-hand side here, is equal to the integral of\n\nF of t dt integrated from 0 to delta t, which is the area under this right-hand curve.\n\nAnd so my average force is just that integral, F of t dt, divided by delta t.\n\nAnd this is integrated from 0 to delta t.\n\nSo that's my average force.",

It's independent of A and B.\n\nSo it depends only upon the endpoints.\n\nSo this is a path independent integral.\n\nAnd since it depends only upon the endpoints, I can write it, since it's going to be an integral from point A to point\n\nB-- this integral must be equal to some function of the final point.\n\nSo some function of r sub B minus some function of the initial point r sub A. And to just get this integral from A to\nB, in our usual way of evaluating a definite integral, it's going to be equal to some function of r B minus some\n\nfunction of r A, since the integral depends only upon the endpoints.\n\nNow, let's call this function-- I'm going to make a sort of funny choice here-- so let's call this function minus U as a\n\nfunction of position factor r.\n\nAnd we'll see the reason for this funny choice of minus sign in just a moment.\n\nSo now with this definition, my work integral, which again, is the integral of F sub c .ds from point A to point B is\n\nnow minus U of r B minus minus U of r A. So in other words, that's minus U of r B-- so minus minus gives me a\nplus U of r sub A.\n\nFor shorthand, I can write that as minus U sub B plus U sub A.\n\nAnd since we start out at point A and go to point B, notice that I can also write this as the negative of the change in\n\nU. Since the final value of U is r U at B and the initial value is U at A, so this minus U B plus U A is equal to minus\ndelta U, the change in U as we go from the initial to the final position.\n\nAnd note that in addition to that, given that this is the work integral, I can summarize that by writing that-- so I'll\n\nsay, note that delta U is equal to the negative of the work done going from point A to point B. Now, let's write the\n\fwork kinetic energy theorem using this newly introduced U function.\n\nSo the work kinetic energy theorem, which tells us that the work done, which we've seen is minus U sub B plus U\n\nsub A is equal to the change in kinetic energy delta k, which I can write as K sub B minus K sub A. Or I could also\n\nwrite that as 1/2 M V B squared minus 1/2 M V A squared.\n\nSo this is just me stating that the work done on the system is equal to the change in kinetic energy.\n\nAnd I can write the work in terms of my function U that I've introduced here to minus U sub B plus U sub A.\n\nSo I'm going to rearrange this equation now-- basically the one involving U's and the one involving kinetic\n\nenergies-- so that I have all the terms involving point A on one side and all the terms involving point B on the other\n\nside.\n\nSo rearranging, I get that at point A 1/2 M V A squared plus U sub A is equal to at point B 1/2 M V B squared plus\n\nU sub B. Now, notice however, that there is nothing special about how I chose the points A and B. They're\n\ncompletely arbitrary.\n\nSo that means that this equation must be true for any points A and B.\n\nAnd what that means is that each side must be equal to the same constant for any point in the system.\n\nSo in fact, we can write that K plus U for any point must be able to some constant, which I'm going to call E sub\nmech.\n\nSo K here is the kinetic energy.\n\nU is my function that I introduced, and we're going to call it the potential energy.\n\nAnd E sub mech-- and remember, this E sub mech here is a constant.\n\nE sub mech is something that we call the total mechanical energy.\n\nNow, what we've done here is that we've shown that the total mechanical energy, which is the sum of the kinetic\nenergy and the potential energy, is a constant under the action of a conservative force.\n\nIn other words, if we look at this equation and look at how it changes with time, the change in the kinetic energy,\n\nplus the change in the potential energy is equal to the change in the total mechanical energy.\n\nAnd this is 0 for our conservative force.\n\fSo in other words, the change in kinetic energy is balanced by the change in potential energy, such that the sum\n\nis 0 when the force acting is conservative.\n\nNow, we've now introduced the very important concept of the potential energy that is associated with the\nconservative force.\n\nAnd we see that the change in the potential energy, the way we defined it, the change in potential energy is equal\n\nto the negative of the work integral for our conservative force going from point A to point B. Now in fact, it's\n\nactually only the change in the potential energy that has physical significance.\n\nWe'll be concerned with potential energy differences or changes.\n\nThe actual value of the potential energy itself doesn't matter.\n\nWe're free to choose any convenient reference point, or 0 point, for measuring the potential energy.\n\nIt's equivalent to choosing a coordinate origin when we're talking about positions.\n\nNow, the potential energy change is related to the work done by conservative forces.\n\nBut we know that in general, work can also be done by non-conservative forces.\n\nAlthough, that work by non-conservative forces will depend upon the path taken from point A to point B.\n\nSo in general, the total work is given by the sum of the conservative work-- the work done by conservative forces,\n\nwhich we can relate to a potential energy change, and the non-conservative work done.\n\nAnd it's this total work that tells us what the change in the kinetic energy is.\n\nNow we'll soon see that in the presence of non-conservative forces, the total mechanical energy, which is K plus\n\nU, is not a constant.",

            "text": "MITOCW | MIT8_01F16_L27v01_360p\nLet's look at some examples of one dimensional elastic collisions with no external forces between two particles.\n\nSo suppose I have particle 1 and particle 2, and we have them moving on a frictionless surface.\n\nAnd let's choose a reference frame in which we'll call-- the laboratory frame-- in which the initial velocity of particle\n\n2 0.\n\nSo our frame is called the laboratory frame.\n\nAnd in this frame we're thinking of particle 2 as our target.\n\nAnd the target is at rest.\n\nAnd particle 1 is moving in with some initial velocity.\n\nAnd so here is our initial picture.\n\nAnd then in our final state, both the target and the particles can be moving.\n\nSo we'll just indicate v1 final.\n\nAnd we'll have target was also moving with v2 final.\n\nAnd we have i hat.\n\nSo let's now look at some examples where we're analyzing this type of collision in which both energy and\nmomentum are constant.\n\nAnd for a particular example that we want to look at, we'll have m2 is twice m1.\n\nNow, for our two equations that we're going to write about, we'll choose components, and we'll write our energy\n\nequation as 1/2 m1 v1 x initial squared plus 1/2 m2-- so now we're going to write 2 m1.\n\nBut object 2 is at rest, so we don't have to worry about that one yet.\n\nAnd so, our initial kinetic energy is just equal to the final kinetic energy-- 1/2 m1 v1 x final squared.\n\nAnd now I'm going to substitute in 2m1 for the mass of m2 v2 x final squared.\n\nAnd that's our energy condition.\n\nAnd then our momentum condition is that the incoming momentum, 1/2 x initial is equal to the outgoing\n\fmomentum, m1 v1 x final.\n\nAnd again, I'm going to substitute for m2.\n\nThat's 2m1 v2 x final.\n\nAnd these two equations represent a system of two equations with two unknowns.\n\nWe'll treat this as givens along with the initial velocity of particle 1.\n\nAnd our target here is to solve for the 1x final and v2 x final.\n\nSo we have two equations and two unknowns.\n\nNow it's a quadratic equation.\n\nSo we have to identify-- from a problem solving strategy, we have to identify which quantity we're going to solve\n\nfirst.\n\nAnd so, let's solve for v1 x final, which means we need to eliminate v2 x final.\n\nAnd the way I'll eliminate v2 x final is I'll use the momentum equation.\n\nAnd notice that the m's will cancel in the momentum equation.\n\nAnd so, if I divide through by 2m in the momentum equation and bring this term over to the other side, equation\n\n2a becomes v2 x final equals-- I'm dividing through by 2-- 1/2 v1 x initial minus 1/2 v1 x final.\n\nSo this gives me a target-- v2 x final-- I can substitute into there.\n\nThis equation, again, can be cleaned up.\n\nLet's clean it up before.\n\nWe can get rid of the halves.\n\nWe can get rid of the m1's.\n\nAnd so the quadratic equation that we're going to be working with is v1 x initial squared equals v1 x final squared.\n\nAnd I'm dividing through by 2.\n\nSo I have the factor 2 plus 2 v2 x final squared.\n\fNow that's our energy equation.\n\nAnd here's our momentum equation.\n\nSo if we substitute this in and square it, we can now substitute and we get v1 x initial squared equals v1 x final\n\nsquared plus 2.\n\nNow we make our substitution.\n\nSo that's 1/2 v1 x initial minus 1/2 v1 x final, quantity squared.\n\nSo let's now expand this.\n\nAnd we have to be careful not to make any mistakes.\n\nv1 x initial squared equals v1 x final squared.\n\nNow if I pull the 2 out, I got a quarter in front, and divide that by 1/2.\n\nSo I get 1/2 v1 x initial squared plus another 1 plus a 1/2 v1 x final squared.\n\nThose represent the-- squaring out those two terms.\n\nNow the cross-term will have a factor of 1/2 in the front but a factor of 2.\n\nSo we have a simple cross-term of v1 x initial v1 x final.\n\nNow, when we-- let's collect terms.\n\nLet's bring everything over to this side so we have a 0 equals 3/2 v1 x final squared minus 1/2 v1 x initial squared\n\nand minus v1 x initial v1 x final.\n\nNow I always like to just write this up in a simple way to use the quadratic formula.\n\nSo I'm going to divide through by 2/3.\n\nAnd I get minus 1/3 v1 x initial squared minus 2/3 v1 x initial v1 x final.\n\nAnd this is now a simple application of the quadratic formula.\n\nNegative b is plus 2/3 v1 x initial plus or minus.\n\fAnd we're going to interpret those two roots in a moment.\n\nWe have to factor 2/3 v1 x initial squared minus 4ac.\n\nSo that's another minus sign with a plus.\n\nSo that's plus 4/3 v1 x initial squared, all to the square root, and everything divided by 2.\n\nNow here, let's just look at this factor.\n\nThis is 4/9 plus 4/3.\n\n4/3 is 12/9, so that's 16/9, which is very convenient, because when you take the square root that's 4/3.\n\nSo we get equal to 2/3 v1 x initial plus or minus 4/3 v1 x initial divided by 2.\n\nNow we see that there's two different roots.\n\nSo when you add them, you get 2 v1 x initial divided by 2.\n\nSo there's one solution.\n\nAnd when you subtract them, you're getting 2/3 minus 4/3.\n\nThat's negative 2/3 divided by 2.\n\nSo that is another solution-- v1 x final equals negative 1/3 v1 x initial.\n\nNow let's think about the meaning of these two possible solutions.\n\nThis solution has v1 x final equals v1 x initial.\n\nSo that's the initial conditions.\n\nJust repeat it.\n\nAnd that will always be the case.\n\nOne solution will describe the initial state, and the other solution will define the final state.\n\nYou can check for yourself that if you just put vx1 final into this-- equal to vx1 in the initial-- into this momentum\nequation, then v2 x final is 0, which just repeats the initial conditions.\n\fSo this solution is the initial state.\n\nAnd this solution, here, is the final state.\n\nNow just to complete the picture, v2 x final-- well, that's equal to 1/2 v1 x initial minus 1/2 times v1 x final.\n\nBut v1 x final is negative 1/3.\n\nSo we have a 1/2 minus 1/2 half times minus 1/3.\n\nSo that's 1/2 plus 1/6, which is 4/6 or 2/3 v x initial.\n\nSo that's 2/3 the v1 x initial.\n\nAnd that represents the solution to this particular problem.\n\nNow, of course what you want to do is, you want to check-- we know the momentum condition is already satisfied.\n\nBut just as a check, you would like to put it into the energy condition just to make sure that when you square these\n\nthings out you get the right terms.\n\nHowever, we're very confident of our result, because we've already reproduced the initial conditions.\n\nAnd that wouldn't happen if we made some algebraic mistake.\n\nSo that, by itself, is a sufficient check that this is a correct solution.\n\nOne thing we should sit back and think about is that when we use the energy and momentum that we're inevitably\ndealing with quadratics.\n\nAnd so we expect to use-- to solve a quadratic equation at one point.\n\nAnd here it was right here.\n\nNow we're going to find another way to do this by linearizing the system, which will be a lot easier.",

            "text": "MITOCW | MIT8_01F16_L30v01_360p\nConsider a rod of mass m, and suppose I apply a force to this rod.\n\nLet's say a force like that.\n\nSo we know that as a result of that applied force, the center of mass of the rod, which we can imagine is right at\n\nthe center the rod, will translate with some acceleration, such that the vector f is equal to the mass of the rod\n\ntimes the acceleration of the center of mass.\n\nNow recall that for a rigid body, this equation will be true regardless of where on the rod I apply the force.\n\nSo for example, if I draw the rod again over here, and I apply the same force, vector f, but I apply it, let's say, on\n\nthe right hand side, I'll still have the same f equals ma.\n\nAll I specify with f is its magnitude and direction.\n\nBut for a rigid body, no matter where on the body I apply that force, the acceleration of the center of mass will be\n\nthe same.\n\nNow, we know from experience, however, that the motion of the rod is different if I push it at the center at one end\n\nor at the other end.\n\nThe point is, though, that the motion, the overall motion, the overall translation of the object doesn't just involve\n\nthe translation of the center of mass, but it also involves some rotation, in general.\n\nSo in fact, there is a theorem called Chasles' theorem, which tells us that the most general displacement of a rigid\nbody can be split into the translation of the center of mass and a rotation about the center of mass.\n\nOur f equals ma relation tells us how an applied force affects the first part of the translation of the center of mass.\n\nBut how does that applied force affect the rotation of the rigid body?\n\nWe'll see that this depends not only on the magnitude and direction of the force, but also on where the force is\n\napplied, OK?\n\nThat's different than the translation of the center of mass, which only depends upon what the force is.\n\nThe rotation about the center of mass depends both upon the force itself and where on the object that it's applied.\n\nIn fact, in the next few lessons, we'll see that there's a special equation of motion for describing rotational motion.\n\nIt's analogous to Newton's Second Law of Motion, analogous to f equals ma, applying to rotational motion.\n\fAnd we write that relationship.\n\nIts rotational equation of motion is written as tau, which is a vector, is equal to i times alpha, which is a vector.\n\nSo tau is a new quantity we haven't talked about before called the torque.\n\nIt's a vector.\n\ni is the moment of inertia that we've already encountered, and alpha is the angular acceleration of the rotational\n\nmotion.\n\nNow, tau is a sort of rotational analog to the force, and it depends on not just the force itself, but on where the\n\nforce is applied.\n\nComputing the torque, tau, depends upon something called a vector product or a cross product.\n\nIt's a way of multiplying two vectors together to produce a third vector.\n\nIn that way, it's different than the dot product or scalar product that we discussed earlier, where we multiply two\n\nvectors together and get a scalar or a pure number.\n\nThis is a different operation, the vector product or cross-product.\n\nTorque is the first physical quantity we've encountered, but it won't be the last, that involves a cross-product in its\n\ndefinition.\n\nAnd so, before giving you a formal definition of torque, we'll first review the mathematics of cross-products, and\n\nwe'll do that in the next lesson.\n\nNow, the angular acceleration, alpha, tells us about how the rotational motion changes.\n\nAgain, just like in f equals ma, where we could divide the two sides of this equation into dynamics and kinematics.\n\nKinematics is telling us about a geometrical description of the motion, or the translation of motion, and the\n\ndynamics f is telling us about how the applied forces cause changes in the motion, changes in the kinematics.\n\nLikewise, for rotational motion, the angular acceleration, alpha, tells us about the geometry of the rotational\nmotion, and specifically how the rotational motion is changing, and the torque is telling us about the application of\n\nforces and how that causes changes in the rotation of motion.\n\fSo that leaves one other quantity, which is the moment of inertia.\n\nAnd I want to talk about what that means for just a moment.\n\nSo the term \"inertia,\" the term \"inertia\" in physics represents a resistance to an applied force.\n\nIt tells us how difficult it is to change an object's motion.\n\nSo for example, suppose I have two blocks, one of mass m and another that's 10 times as massive.\n\nSo 10m.\n\nNewton's Second Law, f equals ma, tells us that if I want to accelerate the heavier mass to the same rate that I do\nwith a smaller mass, I'll need to apply a force that's 10 times larger.\n\nSo for translation of motion, the mass m represents the notion of inertia, the resistance to a force.\n\nIt tells us how much force we have to apply to achieve a certain change in motion.\n\nNow, for rotational motion, that role is played by the moment of inertia i.\n\nThat tells us how difficult it is to change the rotation of an object.\n\nIf I increase the moment of inertia by a factor of 10, then I'll need a torque that is 10 times larger in order to\nachieve the same change in rotational motion, the same angular acceleration.\n\nBut recall that our definition of moment of inertia for some rigid body is, if I break up the rigid body into a bunch of\n\nlittle pieces, and for each piece I take the product of the mass of that piece, delta mj, times the perpendicular\n\ndistance of that piece from the rotation axis-- I call that rj-- and if I sum that over the entire object, the entire body,\n\nthat gives me my moment of inertia.\n\nWell, so-- sorry, this is r squared.\n\nSo it's the mass of each element times the distance of the axis squared, delta mj times rj squared.\n\nNow, I can increase the moment of inertia by a factor of 10 by increasing the total mass of the object, but you can\n\nsee from this equation that I can also do it with the same mass by changing the location of the mass.\n\nIf I increase the r's, if I move the mass, the same mass, but I move it to be farther away from the rotation axis, that\nalso achieves an increase in the moment of inertia.\n\fSo what that tells is that for rotational motion, it's not just the amount of mass that matters, but also how that mass\nis distributed.\n\nOK, so in that sense, rotational inertia is different than translational inertia.\n\nFor translational motion, all that matters is the mass.\n\nIf I increase the mass by a factor of 10, then it will become a factor of 10 more difficult to get that object to\naccelerate.\n\nI need a factor of 10 larger force.\n\nBut with rotational motion, I can increase the notion of inertia.\n\nI can make it more difficult to change the rotation of motion either by changing the mass, by increasing it, or by\n\nmaking the distribution of mass be further away from the rotation axis.\n\nSo as an example, imagine if you were rolling a wheel up a hill.\n\nIt's different if I have a wheel whose mass is distributed evenly over the whole disk, or if I have all of the mass in\nthe rim.\n\nIf all of the mass is in the rim, then from this equation, we see the moment of inertia is larger for the same amount\nof total mass.\n\nAnd so it's much more difficult to roll a wheel up the hill if all of the mass is in the rim than it is if the mass is\ndistributed evenly over the wheel.\n\nSo our rotational equivalent to Newton's Second Law is, tau equals i alpha, the torque equals the moment of\n\ninertia times the angular acceleration.\n\nIn the next few lessons, we'll see how torque is defined, and we'll derive this expression for the dynamics of\n\nrotation of motion and see how to apply it.",

And it's the cross-product of our SJ cross FJ external.\n\nNow, our goal here is only to calculate the Z component of the torque.\n\nSo we can simplify our understanding a little bit by writing out this vector F external J as a component in the plane.\n\nAnd in order to describe that we'll choose some unit vectors.\n\nR hat theta hat going into the plane.\n\nWe'll make another picture in a moment.\n\nSo our vector can have an R component.\n\nAnd I'll keep the external in there.\n\nIt can have a theta hat component.\n\nAnd it can also have a Z component.\n\nBut recall that a cross-product is always perpendicular to either of the elements.\n\nSo when I cross R with anything in the K direction then that component will give a component that's not in the Z\n\ndirection, and so I can ignore that.\n\nSo my first simplification is to say that the Z component will only come from the cross product of RSJ, with these\n\ntwo pieces.\n\nSo that's cross FJR R hat plus FJ theta theta hat.\n\nNow, again we can make another simplification, and perhaps here it's helpful to have another overhead view.\n\nAnd here's our mas element, delta NJ.\n\nThat's our vector from F, from the center, to delta NJ.\n\nWe have unit vectors, R hat, and theta hat.\n\nAnd so we see that this vector, RSJ, has some length in the R hat direction.\n\nSo we're picking S as the origin of our coordinate system.\n\nThis can generalize.\n\fSo we don't worry about if the object is not symmetric.\n\nSo when you take the cross product of R hat verse R hat, that also is zero.\n\nAnd so we see our simplification is quite nice, that the Z component of the torque, is only arising from the sum of J\n\ngoes from 1 to N of our RSJ.\n\nWell, we've already-- we'll write this all as vectors.\n\nR ht cross F J theta theta hat.\n\nNow, again, even if our external force-- by the way, we're dropping external.\n\nWe can always say external, but I think, for simplicity, we'll now drop the external.\n\nAnd what we're considering is just the component of the force.\n\nWe can write that FJ-- this is a little complicated-- theta.\n\nJust the theta hat component of that force.\n\nThis is the only piece of the force that matters in contributing to the Z component of the torque.\n\nAnd this cross-product is very direct because we've chosen a right handed system, where R hat cross theta hat is\n\nK hat.\n\nSo we see that this becomes J equals 1 to N of RSJ FJ theta in the K hat direction.\n\nNow, that's just the calculation of the torque.\n\nBut, as always, it's crucial to understand where Newton's second law appears in these calculations.\n\nAnd Newton's second law, for this mass element, delta MJ, So the second law is telling us that the tangential force\n\nis proportional to the mass element times the tangential acceleration of that mass element.\n\nNow, for this type of rotation about the Z-axis.\n\nSo when we're rotating about that Z-axis we know that AJ theta, so the acceleration of this tangential element, is\n\njust proportional to RJ distance from-- well we've called that our RSJ-- so how far away from the center?\n\nAnd here's the key thing.\n\fIt's also proportional to the Z component of the angular acceleration.\n\nAnd every mass element in the body has the same alpha Z.\n\nAnd so our sum, for the torque, can now be written in the following way.\n\nThe Z component of the torque-- now, I'm going to do something here, which is, I'll write J equals 1 to N, a\nparnetheses mark.\n\nI have one of the RSJs.\n\nI have another RSJ.\n\nA delta MJ.\n\nSo I have delta MJ RSJ squared.\n\nBut every single component has the same alpha Z.\n\nAnd we're in the K hat direction.\n\nNow, because we have a continuous body we have to, again, consider a limit.\n\nSo let's call the limit as delta MJ goes to 0 of this sum, delta MJ RSJ squared.\n\nWell that's an integral over the body of DMRS squared.\n\nAnd we identified that before as the moment of inertia about the Z-axis.\n\nSo the quandary in parentheses is just a measure of the mass distribution about the axis.\n\nYou see the R squared, the delta MJ.\n\nAnd so in conclusion we have that the Z component of the torque is equal to IS alpha Z K hat, which is now a\nvector, because that's the vector alpha.\n\nAnd this is our crucial result for a body that's rotating about the Z-axis.\n\nThis result can generalize to not just a disk, but any body that's looking at the Z component, for this fixed axis\nrotation.",

And here we have a height, h.\n\nand let's have the particles go counterclockwise.\n\nBecause then we can define our k hat vector to go up.\n\nAnd if these particles are going this way, then omega is also going to be going in the k hat direction-- in the\n\npositive k hat direction.\n\nSo we know that L equals r cross p.\n\nSo we need to determine where is r and what's going on with p.\n\nSo our r vector goes here from point s to our first particle, rs1.\n\nAnd here is number two.\n\nAnd we have rs2 sitting over here.\n\nAnd p, the momentum of the particles-- well, if these guys going in the counterclockwise direction, then the\n\nmomentum of particle one is going to go into the board following the direction of the motion.\n\nAnd here p2 is going to come out of the board.\n\nIf we consider this equation here, we can already graphically determine what the answer is actually going to be.\n\nAnd so we do r cross p.\n\nSo r cross p, which means L. Ls1 is going to point in this direction.\n\nLs1.\n\fAnd alternatively, Ls2 is going to go this direction, which means if we add these two components-- and we do want\nthe total angular momentum of the system of both particles.\n\nSo we have to add them.\n\nWe'll get here our L of the system.\n\nSo in order to calculate that, we need to calculate first the Ls1 and then the Ls2.\n\nAnd then we need to add them.\n\nThe crucial point here is to be careful with the coordinate system.\n\nFor the first particle, k is going up.\n\nAnd r is going outwards.\n\nAnd theta hat is going into the board.\n\nThen we can write up Ls1 equals rs1 cross p1.\n\nAnd we can express this vector here with h and with r.\n\nSo we have R in the r hat direction plus h in the k hat direction cross p.\n\nAnd p is the mass of the particle times the angular velocity, the component.\n\nThat is R omega z.\n\nAnd that goes in the theta direction.\n\nSo we need to solve this cross product here.\n\nAnd we're going to have mR squared omega z.\n\nAnd then we have r hat cross theta hat.\n\nThat's k hat plus hmR omega z.\n\nAnd then we have k hat cross theta hat.\n\nThat's anti-cyclic.\n\fAnd we get an r hat.\n\nAnd this is, by the way, an r1.\n\nAnd this is another r1.\n\nAnd we get a minus because it's anti-cyclic.\n\nSo we're going to turn this here into a minus.\n\nAnd that is the angular momentum for our first particle.\n\nNow we're going to do the same in an analogous way for particle number two.\n\nBut again, we need to look at the coordinate system.\n\nThat's very crucial here.\n\nSo k hat still goes up.\n\nr hat now goes into the other direction.\n\nAnd accordingly, theta hat comes out of the board.\n\nAnd then we can just write down our Ls2 here as the same thing, mR squared omega z k hat.\n\nAnd here we have minus hmR omega z r2 hat.\n\nAnd we know from our setup here that r1 equals minus r2 hat.\n\nr1 hat equals minus r2 hat, which means when we now put it all together, we want L equals Ls1 plus Ls2.\n\nWe can tally this up.\n\nAnd from this, we will see that the r hat term actually falls out.\n\nAnd we are left with 2 times the first term.\n\nSo we have 2mR squared omega z k hat.\n\nAnd that's exactly what we wanted.\n\nWe wanted an L pointing in the k hat direction.\n\fThat's exactly this here.\n\nAnd what you can also see is that the 2m here is the mass, the total mass of the system, namely two particles.\n\nWe could add another-- we could do the same exercise again for four points because we'll add two here.\n\nThen we would get 4m here.\n\nSo this is the mass of the system.\n\nAnd if we were to add many, many more points all along the rim here, we get to a solid ring, which means that\neither we know the total mass of the ring that we could stick in here.\n\nOr we can integrate along the rim and then get to the total mass here.\n\nAnd we'll always get to the same kind of form.",

it has an angular velocity.\n\nAnd you can see that that vector is directed into the plane of the board.\n\nNow, what we'd like to do is consider the kinetic energy of this continuous body.\n\nA little bit later on, that body has moved some distance.\n\nAnd what we want to consider is the fact that not only is every point in the body moving with the center of mass\n\nspeed, but there's this additional rotational energy that's associated with the fact that every point in the center of\n\nmass reference frame is undergoing circular motion.\n\nSo how do we describe that?\n\nWell, we'll do that by choosing some point in the body.\n\nSo let's pick a point.\n\nWe'll call that mj, with mass mj.\n\nAnd the velocity of this point, remember, has two components.\n\nTo simplify it, we'll give ourselves a little more picture here.\n\nEvery single point in the object has the vcm.\n\nBut because this object is undergoing circular motion, there is vcmj.\n\nThat's the rotational circular tangential velocity.\n\nAnd so the vector sum of these two is the actual velocity vj of the j-th object.\n\nvj is equal to the center of mass velocity plus the tangential rotational velocity that it has, because it's undergoing\n\ncircular motion.\n\nAnd now what we'd like to do is calculate the kinetic energy of this object.\n\nWell, the kinetic energy is the sum j from 1 to n of 1/2 mj times the velocity of this j-th particle squared, which we\ncan take as a dot product.\n\fSo we can write that as vcm plus vcmj dot vcm plus vcmj.\n\nAnd that's just vj squared.\n\nSo when we look at these terms, it looks complicated at first.\n\nBut there's some nice-- there's going to be vcm dot vcm.\n\nThere's two cross terms.\n\nThey're identical.\n\nAnd vcmj dot vcmj.\n\nSo let's write out those three terms.\n\nWe have 1/2 mj.\n\nvcm dot vcm is vcm squared.\n\nNow, every point in the object has the same vcm.\n\nSo we can pull that one out of the sum.\n\nAnd now we'll take these cross terms.\n\nSo we have the sum over j from 1 to n.\n\nThere's two cross terms.\n\nSo the 2's are going to cancel.\n\nAnd inside here, we have to remember to keep our mass element.\n\nThat's important.\n\nNow, I'm going to write it as mj vcmj vector.\n\nNow, remember, when you dot with vcm, every single point has the same vcm.\n\nEvery j-th element has the same vm, so I can pull that vcm outside.\n\nAnd finally, I have the last term, which is the sum over j from 1 to n of 1/2 mj vcmj squared.\n\fAnd that's just the dot product of those two terms.\n\nAnd so our kinetic energy looks rather complicated, but let's focus on this term right here.\n\nBecause recall from our video on the center of mass that the definition of the center of mass reference frame, so if\n\nyou're moving in the center of mass, that in the center of mass reference frame, the sum of mj vcmj is equal to 0.\n\nSo for instance, if you're in the center of mass frame, you're moving with vcm.\n\nThe only velocity is this.\n\nAnd in that frame, the sum of mj vcmj is 0.\n\nAnd we did a video on that one before.\n\nAnd that's exactly what's in this term.\n\nSo this term is 0.\n\nSo this, remember, was how we defined the center of mass reference frame.\n\nAnd therefore, our kinetic energy consists of two pieces.\n\nThis first piece is just 1/2 the total mass times vcm squared.\n\nAnd our second piece over here, we'll just write it out now-- 1/2 sum over j mj vcmj squared.\n\nNow, if you are moving with the center of mass, then this j-th object is just undergoing circular motion.\n\nAnd so we have our result that we've used many times is that the velocity, the tangential rotational velocity, is just\n\nequal to the radius rsj-- so let's introduce that rsj-- times the angular speed omega.\n\nAnd when we put that into this term, we see our kinetic energy has two pieces-- m total v center of mass squared\n\nplus 1/2 j goes from 1 to n-- I didn't finish that sum there-- mj rsj squared.\n\nNow, just remember that every single point in the object has the same angular speed, and so we can pull out the\nomega squared in there.\n\nAnd because this is a continuous body and we take the limit, as we've done before, as mj goes to 0, this quantity\nof mass times distance squared is just the moment of inertia about the center of mass of that body.\n\fAnd in conclusion, K is 1/2 m total v center of mass squared plus 1/2 the moment of inertia about the center of\n\nmass times the angular speed squared.\n\nNow, this is the same crucial decomposition that we've talked about many times.\n\nThis first piece is what we call the translational kinetic energy, because it just represents how the center of mass is\n\nmoving.\n\nAnd the second piece is what we call the rotational kinetic energy, because it's a representation of just the kinetic\n\nenergy of rotation.\n\nFor example, if you were in the center of mass frame, there would be no translational energy, and this would be\nthe only kinetic energy.",
