People believed the world was in decline from the glorious days of ancient Rome. Then the Black Death shattered this world, killing perhaps a third of Europe's population but also shaking up the old social order and causing people to question old assumptions. Trade was growing, cities were expanding, and a new merchant class was rising. All of these changes set the stage for something new, something we call the Renaissance.",
